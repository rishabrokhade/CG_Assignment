Our project is a simple application to Fold the paper into an Origami model of airplane and unfold it. This project demoes the entire process of folding as well as unfolding. Each folding section has been curved with the line. The single paper is divided into 8 cross sections and each folding position is marked. Each state has been enumerated. The list of points makes it possible to make the fold with recognizing what state to follow. While rendering and movement is done easily but folding with good angle specification is needed. Motion of the Paper while it gets fold (unfold) make more sense as it makes more visibility to user. Paper is the fundamental material and means of this art and holds a considerable importance both from a technical and a decorative point of view.
